ðŸŒŸ Alzheimer's Disease Analysis Project: Unveiling Key Patient Insights ðŸŒŸ

I recently completed an insightful project analyzing Alzheimerâ€™s disease data, focusing on patient demographics and lifestyle factors to better understand potential risks and patterns related to the disease. The dataset I worked with included key patient information such as Patient ID, Age, Education Level, BMI, Smoking Habits, Alcohol Consumption, Physical Activity, Sleep Quality, Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol levels.

Through careful analysis, I used Excel functions to extract meaningful insights and answer specific research questions. For example, I identified patients who smoked, providing insight into smoking as a potential risk factor. I also examined patients with a sleep quality score of more than 5 to understand how sleep patterns might correlate with health outcomes. Additionally, I highlighted patients with high cholesterol levels (greater than 230), which could indicate cardiovascular risks associated with Alzheimer's disease.

One of the key questions involved analyzing blood pressure data, where I extracted the total systolic blood pressure for each patient to further investigate its relation to cognitive health. I also focused on BMI, correlating it with other lifestyle factors to determine its impact on overall well-being and disease progression.

These insights were then visualized through interactive dashboards, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the trends and potential risk factors for Alzheimerâ€™s disease. By incorporating dynamic visualizations, the dashboards highlight not only the disease rate but also the lifestyle factorsâ€”such as smoking, BMI, and cholesterolâ€”that could influence the onset and progression of Alzheimer's.

This project underscored the importance of a multifactorial approach in studying complex diseases like Alzheimer's. By analyzing and visualizing these various health and lifestyle indicators, I was able to pinpoint trends that could assist in both understanding the disease better and potentially improving patient outcomes through targeted interventions.

Iâ€™m excited about how this project has deepened my knowledge in data analysis and visualization while contributing to the important field of Alzheimerâ€™s research. Looking forward to applying these skills to more health-related projects in the future!
